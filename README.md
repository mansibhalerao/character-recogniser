# character-recogniser
This project is recognising the characters from any given image with high precision using maching 
Learning model KNN(K nearest neighbours).<br>
Modules used: <br>
1) Open cv for image reading and processing. <br>
2) Numpy used for dealing with the image as huge multi-dimensional pixel arrays <br>

-> The contours are a used for shape analysis and object detection.
Contours can be explained simply as a curve joining all the continuous points (along the 
boundary), having same color or intensity.
